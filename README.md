## Introduction

While the COVID-19 Pandemic caused soaring unemployment, many corporations reached record profits, and in turn—accelerated the wealth of select billionaires worldwide. The pandemic, coupled with war and sluggish markets, influenced the economy and redefined the capacity of billionaires from 2020 onward. According to Forbes’ 36th-annual ranking of the planet’s richest people, there are 2,668 billionaires in 2022, which is 87 fewer than a year ago. Collectively, the billionaires on Forbes’ list are worth a combined $12.7 trillion—$400 billion less than in 2021. Global politics play a key role in this trend, as the most dramatic drops occurred in Russia, where there are 34 fewer billionaires than last year following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, in China, where a government crackdown on tech companies has led to 87 fewer Chinese billionaires on the list. 

However, in America, billionaire CEOs such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Elon Musk of Tesla/SpaceX experienced dramatic increases in wealth—both personally & in the valuation of their respective companies. Elon Musk specifically topped the World’s Billionaires list for the first time. Moreover, Forbes found more than 1,000 billionaires who are richer than they were a year ago. And 236 newcomers have become billionaires over the past year—including the first ever from Barbados, Bulgaria, Estonia and Uruguay. America maintains a global lead, with 735 billionaires worth a collective $4.7 trillion. China (including Macau and Hong Kong) remains number two, with 607 billionaires worth a collective $2.3 trillion. 

The combination of the Pandemic & global politics creates a particularly unique context for Forbes’ 2022 list of billionaires. This is significant because, by utilizing data analytics & machine learning methodologies, there is an opportunity to investigate the greater impacts of current events on wealth and the future of the global economy. Specifically, in reference to the competition between global powers via a country’s collective private wealth. 

## Description of Data

The Forbes World’s Billionaires list is a snapshot of wealth using stock prices and exchange rates from March 11, 2022. Moreover, Forbes’ also publishes a real-time net worth list, updated daily, of all 2,668 billionaires. However, for the purpose of this study, I will be employing the March 2022 dataset sourced from Kaggle. 

The data is organized in a CSV file with 2,668 rows (one for each billionaire) and 22 columns. The 22 columns include data on the following:

1. Rank
2. Billionaire’s name 
3. Age
4. Net worth (in millions USD)
5. Year of ranking (2022 for all rows)
6. Month of ranking (4 for all rows, meaning April)
7. Category/industry
8. Primary source of wealth 
9. Country of residence
10. State (if applicable)
11. City 
12. Country of citizenship
13. Organization/company
14. Self-made (true or false)
15. Gender
16. Birthdate 
17. Title (CEO, entrepreneur, etc.)
18. Philanthropy score 
19. Residence
20. Number of siblings
21. Bio (short description)
22. Extended biography 

The Forbes’ list includes individuals rather than multigenerational families who share fortunes, though the dataset includes wealth belonging to a billionaire’s spouse and children if that person is the founder of the fortune. In some cases, Forbes’ lists siblings or couples together if the ownership breakdown among them isn’t clear, but here an estimated net worth of $1 billion per person is needed to meet that threshold. Moreover, the calculation includes a variety of assets, including private companies, real estate, art and more. While Forbes does not have access to each billionaire’s private balance sheet (though some provide it), they simply discount fortunes in the cases where documentation is not supplied or available.
