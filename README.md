## Introduction

While the COVID-19 Pandemic caused soaring unemployment, many corporations reached record profits, and in turn—accelerated the wealth of select billionaires worldwide. The pandemic, coupled with war and sluggish markets, influenced the economy and redefined the capacity of billionaires from 2020 onward. According to Forbes’ 36th-annual ranking of the planet’s richest people, there are 2,668 billionaires in 2022, which is 87 fewer than a year ago. Collectively, the billionaires on Forbes’ list are worth a combined $12.7 trillion—$400 billion less than in 2021. Global politics play a key role in this trend, as the most dramatic drops occurred in Russia, where there are 34 fewer billionaires than last year following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, in China, where a government crackdown on tech companies has led to 87 fewer Chinese billionaires on the list. 

However, in America, billionaire CEOs such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Elon Musk of Tesla/SpaceX experienced dramatic increases in wealth—both personally & in the valuation of their respective companies. Elon Musk specifically topped the World’s Billionaires list for the first time. Moreover, Forbes found more than 1,000 billionaires who are richer than they were a year ago. And 236 newcomers have become billionaires over the past year—including the first ever from Barbados, Bulgaria, Estonia and Uruguay. America maintains a global lead, with 735 billionaires worth a collective $4.7 trillion. China (including Macau and Hong Kong) remains number two, with 607 billionaires worth a collective $2.3 trillion. 

The combination of the Pandemic & global politics creates a particularly unique context for Forbes’ 2022 list of billionaires. This is significant because, by utilizing data analytics & machine learning methodologies, there is an opportunity to investigate the greater impacts of current events on wealth and the future of the global economy. Specifically, in reference to the competition between global powers via a country’s collective private wealth.
